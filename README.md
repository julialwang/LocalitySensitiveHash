# docuSearch: A LSH project
Python program that builds LSH from scratch to search and retrieve filenames with similar titles as input.

After running the program, use the default document or whatever .csv file desired to be searched (all titles must be separated by /n newline).
Type in a keyword, phrase, or complete title to browse similar titles within the .csv file.
