# docuSearch: A LSH project
Python program that builds LSH from scratch to search and retrieve filenames with similar titles as input.

After running the program, use the default document or whatever .csv file desired to be searched (all titles must be separated by /n newline).
Type in a keyword, phrase, or complete title to browse similar titles within the .csv file.

Repo also contains a non-randomized brute-force method that can be timed for comparison to optimized algorithm, as well as integrated matplotlib programs to generate timed functions.
